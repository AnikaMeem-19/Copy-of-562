# CIVL562_EnvData
 Materials for CIVL 562 Environmental Data Collection and Analysis

## Make An Environment and Install Required Packages
Step 0 - Install Conda. An easy way to do this is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which contains many of the Python packages we will use.<br>
Step 1 - Clone this github repository from https://github.com/tfmrodge/CIVL562_EnvData. I use [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to manage my local git files.<br>
Step 2 - Open a terminal with Python (I use Anaconda Prompt), navigate to the repository, wherever you located it, e.g. <pre><code> cd C:\GitHub\CIVL562_EnvData </code></pre> then run <pre><code> conda create -n 562env python=3.12 seaborn scipy openpyxl notebook</code></pre><br>
Step 3 - Run the command <pre><code> conda activate 562env</code></pre><br>
Step 4 - Run the command <pre><code> jupyter notebook</code></pre> to open the list of notebooks, and open the "CIVL 562 Lecture Materials" notebook. Note that I may break this up if it seems worthwhile<br>
Step 5 - That's it! Play around with the code and enjoy. Please let me know if you have problems
